I wrote this code myself. The main template for program 1 is from my program 0. I copied it over and th
en modified it.
Other sources that I may have used as inspirations:
        -copied getword.c from ~cssc0062/One/getword.c
	-soft linked getword.h and makefile from ~cssc0062/One/
        -used CS570 Operating Systems (notebook) by Dr. John Carroll (Spring 2018).

Bugs or shortcomings:
        -bytes beginning at address char pointer will be overwritten.
        -Anyone using this routine should have char pointer pointing to an
          available area at least STORAGE bytes long before calling getword().

side notes:
        -I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions,
		 except for:
		 - when something that uses >>. exmaple 123 >> 1234
		 - when something > &outfile. Unsure of how to handle this case.
		 - lowercase mv will call mv from edoras not from p2.
