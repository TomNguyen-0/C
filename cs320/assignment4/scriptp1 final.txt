# File: scriptp1
# Note: It will delete all non-ASCII characters 128 to 255, change the case
# of alphabetic characters, 'fold' long lines, and make browser-friendly
# adjustments to the characters _, /, :, ?, &, and space to %5F, %2F, %3A, %3F, %26, and %20 
# Program 1 in UNIX_pipes; reads from stdin, so run with: scriptp1< inputfile >! filename
# constants used: lower: a-z , upper: A-Z, '\200': character 128 in octal, '\377': character 255, and w20: 20 spaces for fold.
# Steps and descriptions:
# steps: 1. changes lower case to upper case letters and vice versa.
# steps: 2. deltes any ASCII characters 128 to 255, changing characters  _, /, :, ?, &, and space to to %5F, %2F, %3A, %3F, %26, and %20 
# steps: 3: limit the folding to 20 characters in space.
# The return value is: 0 when successfully executed otherwise returns 1
